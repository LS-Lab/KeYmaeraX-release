KeYmaera X Kernel Code Review
=============================

1) The primary purpose of the code review is to check and establish correctness of all soundness-critical parts of the KeYmaera X theorem prover.

2) The secondary purpose of the review is to identify whether there are better ways of implementing KeYmaera X, but precedence will be given to purpose 1). Except for minor edits, those improvements will not be performed during the code review but noted for later inplace with @todo or in a separate file.

During the KeYmaera X Kernel Code Review, the whole source code of the relevant packages will be reviewed for correctness and compliance with the theoretical results. We follow the principle of Cartesian Doubt and scrutinize the code until everybody present is convinced that the code is correct. The code review cannot proceed to other parts of the code until everybody has established its correctness. If anyone present during a kernel code review has any doubt about any part of the code, pertaining to its correctness, the code review cannot move on until the doubt has been settled or a flag has been placed along with an explanation:

 //@todo Code Review: indication of concern or reason or agenda

The code review will only proceed successfully if everybody present clearly and independently stated that he is convinced that the code is correct.

Please don't hesitate at all if some part of the code is unclear to you! It is the purpose of the code review to clarify what the KeYmaera X Kernel does and whether it is correctly doing what it should be doing. Confusion about the code are likely sources of trouble. And simpler code is much easier to get sound than complex contraptions. So it is crucial for the KeYmaera X project to point out possible sources of deficiencies or ambiguities or subtle nuances.

Follow-up: when resolving or addressing all important @todo comments introduced during a Code Review, the git commit messages should identify the issue that they are addressing explicitly. And a corresponding Delta Review needs to be initiated to confirm resolution of the matter. A record of the resolution of the @todo messages should be left explicitly.

KeYmaera X Kernel Code Review Steps
===================================

R1) Expression.scala for correctness and compliance with section 2.1 [1]
R2) StaticSemantics.scala for correctness and compliance with section 2.4 [1]
R3) UniformSubstitution.scala for correctness and compliance with section 3.0 [1]
R4) UniformRenaming.scala for correctness
R5) Proof.scala for correctness and compliance with [1,2]
R6) AxiomBase.scala for correctness and compliance with Fig 2+3 [1] as well as [3] for sequent calculus
R7) SetLattice.scala for correctness, and Errors.scala, core.PrettyPrinter.scala, QETool.scala

If you are convinced of the correct implementation of the KeYmaera X Kernel you will indicate so by verbal agreement and by signing the same commit with your secret gpg key to which only you have access. We will also be placing a tag to clearly mark the reviewed version of the code.

Changes to the KeYmaera X Kernel need to be reviewed periodically in similar ways. Regular full core reviews are advised. Smaller changes will review only the differences formally (Delta Review) or informally (unmarked).

If there are any questions about the KeYmaera X Kernel code review or any suggestions on how it could be improved, please ask! Questions and clarifications are good!

Extended Code Review:
In addition to the above files, an extended code review also considers
R8) parser package: PrettyPrinter.scala, KeYmaeraXPrettyPrinter.scala, OpSpec.scala
R9) lemma package: LemmaDB.scala, LemmaDBFactory.scala, FileLemmaDB.scala for correctness
R10) critical parts of tools package: Tool*.scala, SMT*.scala, KeYmaera*.scala, Mathematica*.scala

The date of last full code review is added to the top of the file as @note Code Review: 2016-03-22.
A log of all major code reviews and the findings are reported here:
Extended Code Review: KeYmaera X Core: 2016-06-01
  TODO Clean handling of assumptions about interpreted functions. For example unproved premises that are substituted in with *formula* definitions in the end.
  TODO FileLemmaDB needs to check all evidence not just the first.
  TODO SMTSolvers cannot return False on satisfiable negations, because formulas other than false have satisfiable negations.
  TODO Mathematica name clashes
  TODO Confirm converse contract checking for translations
  TODO Mathematica and SMT: clarify nary operators like - and *
  TODO Synchronize query index updating (concurrent tool uses)
  TODO Enforce memory management for Mathematica input expressions
  TODO SMT conversion: power handling has inconsistencies
  TODO SMT conversion: ^1 handling needs to be checked since translated as (* x)
  TODO Safeguard return values from SMT solvers
  TODO Polya should improve like Z3 does

Code Review: KeYmaera X Core Delta: 2016-06-01
  NOTE Could turn DifferentialProgram into non-Program.
  TODO Turn "[:=] assign exists" into DerivedAxiom
  TODO Add checksum test and core version to string representation of Lemma. And Lemma name sanity.

Code Review: KeYmaera X Core: 2016-03-09
SetLattice reviewed and changed to pair matching style to improve readability. A few name changes.
  NOTE Fixed Skolemize which was found to be unsound because of checking only with respect to literal mentions of free variables via freeVars(e).symbols instead of freeVars(e).

Code Review: KeYmaera X Core except SetLattice: 2016-03-08
  NOTE Rule.LAX_MODE=true has become acceptable but not preferred since not needed in theory.
  TODO Confirm that ODESystem should turn into non-DifferentialProgram while DifferentialProgram should turn into non-Program.
  TODO Delete Sequent.pref
  TODO Turn "[:=] assign exists" into DerivedAxiom
  TODO Add checksum test and core version to string representation of Lemma. And Lemma name sanity.

Extended Code Review: KeYmaera X Core: 2015-08-25
  TODO Rule.LAX_MODE=false, which affects BoundVariableRenaming and URename and RCF trusted tools
  TODO FileLemmaDB.scala: move out of core

  TODO SMTConversions.scala: resolve issues

Code Review: KeYmaera X Core: 2015-08-24
  TODO Proof.scala: BoundVariableRenaming.compatibilityMode should be false
  TODO Proof.scala: UniformRenaming.semanticRenaming should be false

Code Review: KeYmaera X Core: 2015-05-01
