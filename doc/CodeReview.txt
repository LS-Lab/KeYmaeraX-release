KeYmaera X Kernel Code Review
=============================

1) The primary purpose of the code review is to establish correctness of all soundness-critical parts of the KeYmaera X theorem prover.

2) The secondary purpose of the review is to identify whether there are better ways of implementing KeYmaera X, but precedence will be given to purpose 1). Those improvements will not be performed during the code review but noted for later in a separate todo file.

During the KeYmaera X Kernel Code Review, the whole source code will be reviewed for correctness and compliance with the theoretical results. We follow the principle of Cartesian Doubt and scrutinize the code until everybody present is convinced that the code is correct. The code review cannot proceed to other parts of the code until everybody has established its correctness. If anyone present during a kernel code review has any doubt about any part of the code, pertaining to its correctness, the code review cannot move on until the doubt has been settled or a flag has been placed along with an explanation:

 //@todo Code Review: postponed

The code review will only proceed successfully if everybody present clearly and independently stated that he is convinced that the code is correct.

Please don't hesitate at all if some part of the code is unclear to you! It is the purpose of the code review to clarify what the KeYmaera X Kernel does and whether it is correctly doing what it should be doing. Confusion about the code are likely sources of trouble. And simpler code is much easier to get sound than complex contraptions. So it is crucial for the KeYmaera X project to point out possible sources of deficiencies or ambiguities.

KeYmaera X Kernel Code Review Steps
===================================

R1) Expression.scala for correctness and compliance with section 2.1 [1,2]
R2) StaticSemantics.scala for correctness and compliance with section 2.3 [1,2]
R3) UniformSubstitution.scala for correctness and compliance with section 3.0 [1,2]
R4) UniformRenaming.scala for correctness
R5) Proof.scala for correctness and compliance with [1,2,3]
R6) AxiomBase.scala for correctness and compliance with Fig 2+3 [1,2,4]
R7) SetLattice.scala for correctness, and Errors.scala, core.PrettyPrinter.scala
R8) QETool.scala for correctness

If you are convinced of the correct implementation of the KeYmaera X Kernel you will indicate so by verbal agreement and by signing the same commit with your secret gpg key to which only you have access. We will also be placing a tag to clearly mark the reviewed version of the code.

Changes to the KeYmaera X Kernel need to be reviewed periodically in similar ways.

If there are any questions about the KeYmaera X Kernel code review or any suggestions on how it could be improved, please ask! Questions and clarifications are good!

Extended Code Review:
In addition to the above files, an extended code review also considers
R9) parser package: PrettyPrinter.scala, KeYmaeraXPrettyPrinter.scala, OpSpec.scala
R10) lemma package: LemmaDB.scala + FileLemmaDB.scala for correctness
R11) tools package: Tool*.scala, Mathematica*.scala, KeYmaera*.scala, SMT*.scala

The date of last full code review is added to the top of the file as @note Code Review: 2016-03-09.
A log of all major code reviews and the findings are reported here:
Code Review: KeYmaera X Core Delta: 2016-06-01
  NOTE Could turn DifferentialProgram into non-Program.
  TODO Turn "[:=] assign exists" into DerivedAxiom
  TODO Add checksum test and core version to string representation of Lemma. And Lemma name sanity.


Code Review: KeYmaera X Core: 2016-03-09
SetLattice reviewed and changed to pair matching style to improve readability. A few name changes.
  NOTE Fixed Skolemize which was found to be unsound because of checking only with respect to literal mentions of free variables via freeVars(e).symbols instead of freeVars(e).

Code Review: KeYmaera X Core except SetLattice: 2016-03-08
  NOTE Rule.LAX_MODE=true has become acceptable but not preferred since not needed in theory.
  TODO Confirm that ODESystem should turn into non-DifferentialProgram while DifferentialProgram should turn into non-Program.
  TODO Delete Sequent.pref
  TODO Turn "[:=] assign exists" into DerivedAxiom
  TODO Add checksum test and core version to string representation of Lemma. And Lemma name sanity.
