/* Safety specification of the form: initial -> [{ctrl;plant}*]safe

 * The start braking condition SB is not defined in the ETCS specification, which is modelled with a non-deterministic
 * assignment SB := * (choose any value for SB). The model, therefore, is not provable. Instead, we use KeYmaera X
