  <kbd>dI</kbd> proves a property <code>P</code> to be a differential invariant, i.e., true locally in the direction of the dynamics by reducing it to its differential <code>(P)'</code> after assigning the right-hand side <code>f(x)</code> of the ODE to its left-hand side <code>x'</code>.
  Notice how <kbd>dI</kbd> reduces a property of an ODE <code>x'=f(x)</code> to a property of a discrete assignment <code>x':=f(x)</code>.
  The resulting formula <code>[x':=f(x)](P)'</code> can be thought of as the Lie-derivative of <code>P</code> along the ODE <code>x'=f(x)</code>.
