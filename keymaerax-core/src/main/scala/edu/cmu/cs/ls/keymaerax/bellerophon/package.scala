/**
 * Bellerophon tactics language framework. This package includes
 *   - [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.bellerophon.BelleExpr tactic language expressions]]
 *   - [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.bellerophon.SequentialInterpreter sequential tactic interpreter]] for BelleExpr
 *
 * All Bellerophon tactic expressions are of type [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.bellerophon.BelleExpr]], which provides the
 * following tactic combinators
 *
 *   - `s & t` alias `s ; t` [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.bellerophon.SeqTactic sequential composition]] executes `t` on
 *     the output of `s`, failing if either fail.
 *   - `s | t` [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.bellerophon.EitherTactic alternative composition]] executes `t` if applying `s`
 *     fails, failing if both fail.
 *   - `t*` [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.bellerophon.SaturateTactic saturating repetition]] executes tactic `t` repeatedly
 *     to a fixpoint, casting result to type annotation, diverging if no fixpoint.
 *   - `t*n` [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.bellerophon.RepeatTactic bounded repetition]] executes `t` tactic `n` number of
 *     times, failing if any of those repetitions fail.
 *   - `t+` saturating repetition executes tactic `t` to a fixpoint, requires at least one successful application.
 *   - `<(e1,...,en)` [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.bellerophon.BranchTactic branching]] to run tactic `ei` on branch `i`,
 *     failing if any of them fail or if there are not exactly `n` branches.
 *   - `case _ of {fi => ei}`
 *     [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.bellerophon.USubstPatternTactic uniform substitution case pattern]] applies the first
 *     `ei` such that `fi` uniformly substitutes to current provable for which `ei` does not fail, fails if the `ei` of
 *     all matching `fi` fail.
 *
 * [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.bellerophon.PositionalTactic Positional tactics]] support flexible modes of identifying
 * what position to apply them to via [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.bellerophon.AtPosition]]. Applying a positional tactic
 * `t` at a position supports many different ways of specifying the position:
 *
 *   - `t(1)` applied at the first [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.core.Sequent.succ succedent]] formula.
 *   - `t(-1)` applied at the first [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.core.Sequent.ante antecedent]] formula.
 *   - `t(-4, 0::1::1::Nil)` applied at [[PosInExpr subexpression positioned at]] `.0.1.1` of the fourth antecedent
 *     formula, that is at the second child of the second child of the first child of the fourth antecedent formula in
 *     the sequent.
 *   - `t('L)` applied at the first applicable position in the [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.core.Sequent.ante antecedent]]
 *     (left side of the sequent).
 *   - `t('R)` applied at the first applicable position in the [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.core.Sequent.succ succedent]]
 *     (right side of the sequent).
 *   - `t('_)` applied at the first applicable position in the side of the sequent to which tactic `t` applies. The side
 *     of the sequent is uniquely determined by type of tactic.
 *   - `t('Llast)` applied at the last antecedent position (left side of the sequent).
 *   - `t('Rlast)` applied at the last succedent position (right side of the sequent).
 *
 * In addition, the formulas expected or sought for at the respective positions identified by the locators can be
 * provided, which is useful for tactic contract and tactic documentation purposes. It is also useful for finding a
 * corresponding formula by pattern matching.
 *
 *   - `t(2, fml)` applied at the second [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.core.Sequent.succ succedent]] formula, ensuring that
 *     the formula `fml` is at that position.
 *   - `t(-2, fml)` applied at the second [[edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.core.Sequent.ante antecedent]] formula, ensuring
 *     that the formula `fml` is at that position.
 *   - `t(5, 0::1::1::Nil, ex)` applied at [[infrastruct.PosInExpr subexpression positioned at]] `.0.1.1` of the fifth
 *     succedent formula, that is at the second child of the second child of the first child of the fifth succedent
 *     formula in the sequent, ensuring that the expression `ex` is at that position.
 *   - `t('L, fml)` applied at the antecedent position (left side of the sequent) where the expected formula `fml` can
 *     be found (on the top level).
 *   - `t('R, fml)` applied at the succedent position (right side of the sequent) where the expected formula `fml` can
 *     be found (on the top level).
 *   - `t('_, fml)` applied at the suitable position (uniquely determined by type of tactic) where the expected formula
 *     `fml` can be found (on the top level).
 *
 * Which of the available tactics is actually shown on the User Interface is determined by [[UIIndex]].
